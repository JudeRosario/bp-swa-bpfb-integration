BuddyPress addon to integrate Site Wide Activity and Activity+ 

[Site Wide Activity from BuddyDev](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-sitewide-activity-widget/) lets you can show the sitewide activity in a widget area, while [BuddyPress Activity Plus](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/media-embeds-for-buddypress-activity/) allows your users to upload and share images, videos and links across your BuddyPress site.

This plugin integrates both and lets you have the best of both worlds. You can now have BuddyPress activity feeds displayed as a widget, while allowing for users to upload rich content like images, links & videos
